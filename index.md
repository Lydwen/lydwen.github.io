## Who am I?

I'm an engineer in Computer Science with a minor in Software Architecture, recently graduate from Polytech Nice-Sophia (2017 promotion).

Video game and game design lover, I'm currently searching a first job as a gameplay developer or a tool developer.

I think a good developer is someone who is passionate and creative, who has a team spirit, produce code that is maintenable,  upgradable, i.e. a comprehensive and readable code. Anyone can learn a programming language, but to know how to get back on something that has been produced to improve it, make a software component "beautiful", suggest an architecture to reach some properties expressing the pros and cons and decide together if it's the right solution, it's all of these things which allows to say "I am an Engineer".

If I want to join the video game industry, it's because I believe that it's the best medium to reach people's heart and bring them something. It can be joy, tears, personal thoughts or thought on another person, the player involvment is what that let them to live a mindful and unique moment.

## Video Game projects

### Eat Hat AR - Online turn-based strategy game in Augmented Reality
_Final year project presented at the **"Festival Internation des Jeux de Cannes 2017"**._

The board is a 4 tiles sided cube, which is manipulated in real life (a wooden cube) to move a virtual cube. 

My work :
- Design and development of the data model (cubical representation of the board and movements of the pawns around it).
- Design and develop the client-server communication abstraction.
- Design and develop the load balancer in Go.

This project took us one semester, in parallel with our other courses. We were four developers (three of us with a minor in Software Architecture, and one in Human-Machine Interaction) and one 3D artist. EatHat AR is a turn based strategy game
